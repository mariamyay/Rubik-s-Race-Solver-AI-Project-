# Rubik's Race Solver

This project implements several search algorithms to solve the Rubik's Race game. The implemented algorithms include A* and IDA* with Manhattan Distance, Number of Misplaced Tiles. Additionally, it explores Hill Climbing and Breadth-First Search from the uninformed search strategies.
## Requirements


**`Python`** 3.11.7 

**`packages`**:  matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, time, random, heapq, copy

## Project Structure

1. **`rubiks_race_solver`**: Main script containing the implementation of Rubik's Race solving algorithms.

2. **`board`**: Module defining the Rubik's Race game board and related operations.

3. **`heuristics`**: Module with implementations of different heuristics used in the A* and IDA* algorithms.

4. **`algorithms`**: Module with A* and IDA* algorithm implementations.

5. **`uninformed_search`**: Module with Hill Climbing and Breadth-First Search algorithm implementations.


## Usage

On the **`rubiks_race_solver`**, you can see comments like ''using manhattan distance heuristic'', uncomment the scripts below and run. The desired algorithm will be executed. Also specify the desired size of a grid.
